# Polo
Polo is a binned fitter that is based on MINT (Minuit Interface). It is designed for the study of both quantum correlated DDb decays, and B->Dh (and similar) decays. It is especially useful when the D decays to a final states with has a binned, multi-dimension phase space.


To use Polo you just need to have ROOT installed. The relevant MINT code has been copied into this library, 
so you do not need to download the MINT libs.

To get up and running, simply do:

git clone https://github.com/samharnew/Polo.git

cd Polo/example
./src/example < empty.txt

The example (and the rest of the code) is commented, so hopefully it should be clear how things work. Enjoy
